# RaspiBlockClock

A Bitcoin node montier GUI which displays various statistics of your personal node when paired with a raspberry pi and a 320x480 TFT LCD screen.

If the image does not show up on the screen, SSH into the Pi and use the command 'export DISPLAY=:0' to force the Pi to load the program onto the LCD display.
